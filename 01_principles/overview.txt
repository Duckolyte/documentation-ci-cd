What makes a continuous integration pipeline 

Repeatable reliable process 
Playbooks of deployment in each organization should be same.

Automate everything 
Playbook tasks should be automated and not runned by human activity.

Version control 
System to enable developers to collaborate on a shared code base.

Build in quality 
Quality is integrated into every step of the release pipeline.
Project planning for new feature releases should include considerations around 
analytics, performance monitoring, and automated testing instrumentation tasks.

Do the hardest parts first
Painful, time-consuming or error-prone tasks compound over time.
So fixing these saves time for the customers and are a great win and therefore 
should be done first. Helps identifying weaknesses in the organizational 
process. 

Everyone is responsible 
Active planning by product managers and the security team as well as the devs 
for deplyoment and production realease is required.

"Done" means released 
CD means ship the software to the end user and not "it works on my machine".

Continuous improvement 
The feedback loop is the heart of CD.
